My name is Marcos Garcia Marti (or in short, *Marc Garcia*)
I work at Microsoft as a Cloud Solutions Architect, specialized in Azure Infrastructure, sysadmin and networking stuff
I spent many years working with Linux so I often help customers with that as well.

I hold an MBA from John Molson School of Business (Concordia University) and Engineering degrees in Telecommunication and Computer Science from the Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya.
